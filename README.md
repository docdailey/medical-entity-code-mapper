![Visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=docdailey.medical-entity-code-mapper)

A high-performance medical entity extraction and coding system that identifies clinical entities in text and maps them to standard medical ontologies (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm).

## üíª System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel), Linux
- **Memory**: 32GB RAM recommended (16GB minimum)
- **Storage**: ~10GB free space for models and indices
- **Python**: 3.10 - 3.13
- **Package Manager**: [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Rust-based Python package manager)

*Tested on Mac Studio M2 Max with 32GB RAM*

## üéØ Purpose

This system addresses the critical need for automated medical coding by:
- Extracting medical entities from clinical text using state-of-the-art NER models
- Mapping entities to multiple medical coding systems simultaneously
- Providing context-aware code selection (e.g., adult vs pediatric codes)
- Offering high-performance TCP socket servers for production deployment
- **NEW**: TLS encryption for secure handling of sensitive healthcare data

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Ontology Support**: ICD-10-CM, SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, HCPCS
- **Advanced NER**: Multiple BERT-based models for comprehensive entity extraction
- **Context-Aware Coding**: Intelligent code selection based on clinical context
- **High Performance**: Vector similarity search using FAISS with BGE-M3 embeddings
- **Production Ready**: TCP socket servers with dynamic batching and MPS acceleration
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Enhanced with UMLS Metathesaurus synonyms
- **Automatic Model Management**: Models downloaded automatically on first run
- **Medical Device Recognition**: HCPCS codes for devices, supplies, and equipment

## üì¶ Data Storage

The system automatically downloads:
- **NER Models** (~2GB): Clinical entity recognition models
- **BGE-M3 Model** (~2GB): Embedding model for similarity search  
- **FAISS Indices** (~9GB): Pre-built indices hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/docdailey/medical-entity-code-mapper-indices)

All data is downloaded on first run and cached locally.

## üè• Supported Medical Ontologies

1. **ICD-10-CM** (Port 8901)
   - 559,940 diagnostic codes with UMLS synonyms
   - Context-aware selection (adult vs pediatric)
   
2. **SNOMED CT** (Port 8902)
   - 350,000+ clinical concepts
   - Comprehensive medical terminology
   
3. **LOINC** (Port 8903)
   - 104,000+ laboratory and clinical codes
   - Test results and observations
   
4. **RxNorm** (Port 8904)
   - 270,000+ medication concepts
   - Drug names, ingredients, and formulations
   
5. **HCPCS** (Port 8905)
   - 8,725 codes for medical devices and supplies
   - Durable medical equipment (DME)
   - Distinguishes devices from medications
   
### Medical Device Recognition

The system automatically detects medical devices in clinical text and routes them to HCPCS instead of RxNorm:

```python
# Example: "Patient has a urinary catheter" 
# ‚Üí Detected as device (not medication)
# ‚Üí Coded as HCPCS C1758 (Catheter, ureteral)
```

Supported device categories:
- Catheters (urinary, IV, central line, PICC)
- Mobility aids (wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, canes)
- Respiratory equipment (CPAP, BiPAP, nebulizers, oxygen)
- Monitoring devices (glucose meters, blood pressure monitors)
- Surgical supplies (syringes, needles, dressings, sutures)
- DME (hospital beds, lifts, commodes)
- Prosthetics and orthotics

## üîí Security Features

### TLS Encryption (NEW)
Protect sensitive healthcare data with TLS-encrypted communication:

```bash
# Generate certificates
python scripts/generate_certificates.py --type self-signed  # Development
python scripts/generate_certificates.py --type csr --domain yourdomain.com  # Production

# Start ALL TLS-enabled servers at once
python scripts/start_tls_servers.py

# Or run individual TLS servers
export TLS_CERT_FILE=certs/server.crt
export TLS_KEY_FILE=certs/server.key
python src/servers/icd10_server_tls.py   # Port 8911 (ICD-10 TLS)
python src/servers/snomed_server_tls.py  # Port 8912 (SNOMED TLS)
python src/servers/loinc_server_tls.py   # Port 8913 (LOINC TLS)
python src/servers/rxnorm_server_tls.py  # Port 8914 (RxNorm TLS)
python src/servers/hcpcs_server_tls.py   # Port 8915 (HCPCS TLS)

# Connect with TLS client
python examples/tls_client_example.py
```

**TLS Server Ports:**
- ICD-10 TLS: 8911 (standard: 8901)
- SNOMED TLS: 8912 (standard: 8902)
- LOINC TLS: 8913 (standard: 8903)
- RxNorm TLS: 8914 (standard: 8904)
- HCPCS TLS: 8915 (standard: 8905)

**Security Notes:**
- All TLS servers use TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers
- Self-signed certificates for development only
- Production requires proper CA-signed certificates
- Optional mutual TLS for client authentication
- Never commit certificates or keys to git

## üîß Quick Start

### 1. Install UV

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or with Homebrew
brew install uv
```

### 2. Clone and Run

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/docdailey/medical-entity-code-mapper.git
cd medical-entity-code-mapper

### üìà Estimated Performance on M3 Ultra (512GB RAM)

Based on architectural improvements and memory bandwidth scaling:

| Server   | Est. QPS | Est. Latency | Performance Gain | Notes                           |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| HCPCS    | 750-850  | <150ms       | 2.0x             | Small index fits in cache       |
| LOINC    | 600-700  | <200ms       | 2.0x             | Benefits from faster memory     |
| RxNorm   | 400-500  | <300ms       | 2.0x             | Large index gains from RAM      |
| SNOMED   | 350-450  | <350ms       | 2.0x             | Complex queries scale well      |
| ICD-10   | 300-400  | <400ms       | 2.0x             | 512GB eliminates memory pressure|

**M3 Ultra Advantages:**
- **16x memory**: 512GB vs 32GB eliminates swapping for large indices
- **2x GPU cores**: 76-core vs 38-core GPU doubles MPS throughput
- **2x memory bandwidth**: 800GB/s vs 400GB/s accelerates FAISS operations
- **All indices in RAM**: Zero disk I/O during operation
- **Larger batch sizes**: Can increase max_batch from 25 to 50-100

### Running Optimized Servers

```bash
# Start all optimized servers
python scripts/start_optimized_servers.py

# Benchmark optimized servers
python scripts/benchmark_optimized.py

# Run specific heavy load test
python scripts/benchmark_optimized.py --load heavy --requests 1000 --threads 100
```

### Key Performance Features

- **MPS Acceleration**: Leverages Apple Silicon GPU for embedding computation
- **Dynamic Batching**: Automatically batches requests for optimal throughput
- **FAISS HNSW Index**: O(log n) search complexity for fast similarity matching
- **Persistent Connections**: Supports connection reuse for reduced latency
- **Zero-copy Protocol**: Efficient TCP socket communication

### Performance Tuning Tips

1. **For M2 Max (32GB)**: Keep batch sizes at 25, use 3 workers
2. **For M3 Ultra (512GB)**: Increase batch sizes to 50-100, use 6-8 workers
3. **Memory-constrained systems**: Reduce max_batch_size and workers
4. **CPU-bound workloads**: Increase inference workers to CPU core count
5. **Network optimization**: Use Unix sockets for local deployments
